While mean represents the average value, and median represents the middle value, mode represents the value that occurs most often in a data set. It is particularly useful when analyzing categorical data, or when identifying the most common occurrence within a set of values. A data set can have one mode, or more than one mode if there are multiple values that occur with equal frequency (known as bimodal, trimodal, etc.).

It is a metric that quantifies the degree to which the values in a dataset are spread out around the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates that the values are more widely distributed, while a lower standard deviation indicates that the values are clustered more closely around the mean. Standard deviation is an important tool in data analysis because it helps to identify outliers and understand the shape of the distribution of values in a dataset.\n",

        "**Quantiles** are statistical measures used to divide a given dataset into equal portions. They are mainly used to analyze data by dividing it into smaller segments based on their relative position in the entire dataset. For instance, the median is a type of quantile that represents the 50th percentile value, which splits the data into two equal halves. Similarly, other common quantiles include **quartiles**, which are used to divide data into four equal parts, and **deciles**, which divide data into ten equal parts. These measures enable analysts to better understand the distribution of data and identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent when looking at the data as a whole."

It is calculated by finding the difference between the upper quartile (Q3) and the lower quartile (Q1). Quartiles are values that divide a dataset into quarters, with Q1 representing the 25th percentile and Q3 representing the 75th percentile. The IQR is often used in conjunction with the median to provide a more complete understanding of the spread of data. It is a robust measure of spread because it is not affected by extreme values, or outliers, in the dataset."
