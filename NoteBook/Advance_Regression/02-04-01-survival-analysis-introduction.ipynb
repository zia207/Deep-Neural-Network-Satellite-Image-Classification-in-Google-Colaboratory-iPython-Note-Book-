        "Survival analysis is a branch of statistics that focuses on analyzing time-to-event data. It is commonly used to study the duration until a specific event occurs, such as time until death, disease relapse, or machine failure. This method is especially useful when the timing of the event is the primary concern, and it accounts for cases where some individuals may not experience the event during the study period, a situation known as censoring."

        "### 1. **Non-parametric Methods**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Overview:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Non-parametric survival analysis** involves techniques that make no assumptions about the underlying distribution of survival times.

It provides an empirical survival curve that shows the probability of survival over time, often used in medical research to estimate survival probabilities and visualize the proportion of subjects surviving at different points in time\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Features:\n",

        "-   Does not require assumptions about the underlying distribution of survival times.\n",

        "#### Model Structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "The Kaplan-Meier estimator calculates survival probabilities by dividing the study time into intervals and updating survival probability estimates each time an event occurs. The survival probability is calculated using the formula:\n",

        "#### Overview:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   The **Cox proportional-hazards model** is the most widely used survival regression model. It is **semi-parametric**, meaning it makes no assumptions about the baseline hazard function but assumes that the hazard ratios between different groups are constant over time.\n",

        "-   **Proportional hazards assumption**: The model assumes that the effect of covariates on survival is multiplicative and remains constant over time.\n",
        "-   The model estimates **hazard ratios (HR)** for different covariates. A hazard ratio greater than 1 indicates an increased risk of the event, while a hazard ratio less than 1 indicates a protective effect.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Model Structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "The hazard function for an individual with covariates $x_1, x_2, ..., x_p$ is:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Unlike the Cox model, parametric models assume that survival times follow a specific probability distribution. These models are fully parametric because they specify both the baseline hazard function and how covariates affect it.\n",

        "\n",
        "-   This model is simple but restrictive because the hazard rate cannot increase or decrease over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to use**: For modeling processes where the event risk is believed to be constant over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "\n",
        "**b. Weibull Model**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   More flexible than the exponential model, as it allows for a changing hazard rate over time (increasing or decreasing).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hazard function**: $$ h(t) = \\lambda p t^{p-1} \\exp(\\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + ...) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where: - $p$: Shape parameter that controls the nature of the hazard function. If $p > 1$, the hazard increases over time (e.g., aging). If $p < 1$, the hazard decreases over time (e.g., machines breaking down early).\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to use**: When you expect the event risk to change over time.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Survival time**: For the log-normal model, $\\log(T)$ follows a normal distribution, while for the log-logistic model, $\\log(T)$ follows a logistic distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Log-normal**: Used in cases where survival times are skewed and can't be modeled with standard distributions.\n",
        "-   **Log-logistic**: Similar to the log-normal, but often more flexible in certain tail behaviors.\n",

        "#### Overview:\n",

        "#### Key Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Instead of modeling the hazard function directly, the AFT model assumes that the effect of covariates acts multiplicatively on the time scale.\n",

        "$$ \\log(T) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + ... + \\epsilon $$\n",

        "\n",
        "-   **Linear relationship**: The logarithm of the survival time is modeled as a linear function of the covariates.\n",
        "-   AFT models can use various distributions like exponential, Weibull, log-normal, and log-logistic for survival times.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### When to Use:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   When the effect of covariates is multiplicative on the time scale (i.e., they speed up or slow down the time to event).\n",
        "-   Often used when the proportional hazards assumption doesn’t hold, but a parametric time-to-event model is appropriate.\n",

        "There are various extensions of the Cox proportional-hazards model to deal with specific challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "**a. Time-Dependent Covariates**: In some cases, covariates may change over time (e.g., blood pressure or tumor size). A time-dependent Cox model allows the incorporation of covariates that vary with time.\n",
