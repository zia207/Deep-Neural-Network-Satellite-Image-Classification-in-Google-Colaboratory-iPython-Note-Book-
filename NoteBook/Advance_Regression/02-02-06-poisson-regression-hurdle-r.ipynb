        "# 6. Hurdle Model\n",
        "\n",
        "In count data analysis, we often encounter datasets with excessive zeros. These zeros can be problematic for standard Poisson or negative binomial models, as they typically assume that zero counts arise from the same process as positive counts. However, in many cases, zeros and positive counts result from distinct processes. For example, in modeling the number of visits to a gym, some people never visit (true zeros), while others visit at varying frequencies. The hurdle model is designed to handle this by splitting the modeling process into two parts: one to handle zero vs. non-zero outcomes and another to model the positive counts.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial introduces hurdle models in R, where we’ll start with a model overview, explaining how hurdle models work to separate zero and count components. We’ll then cover how to fit hurdle models from scratch to understand their two-part structure, and we’ll use the {pscl} package for efficient model fitting. Finally, we’ll discuss model comparison techniques, such as the likelihood ratio and Vuong tests, to assess fit quality and evaluate prediction performance on test data to validate the model."

        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "A **hurdle model** is a type of statistical model used to analyze count data, particularly when the data has an excess number of zeros (zero-inflated data). It is commonly applied in scenarios where there are two separate processes: one that governs whether an event occurs (i.e., whether the count is zero or non-zero) and another that determines the count value once the event occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Key Features of the Hurdle Model***\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Two-Part Structure**:\n",
        "    -   **First part (Hurdle component)**: This models the probability that the count is greater than zero (i.e., whether the \"hurdle\" is crossed). Typically, this is done using a binary model, like **logistic regression** or **probit regression**.\n",
        "    -   **Second part (Count component)**: This models the count of events given that the count is greater than zero. Common models for this part include **Poisson** or **negative binomial regression**, depending on the distribution of the non-zero counts.\n",
        "2.  **Zero-Inflation Handling**:\n",
        "    -   The hurdle model is specifically designed to address data where zeros are more frequent than would be expected from standard count models, like Poisson or negative binomial models. This makes it useful in contexts like healthcare (e.g., number of hospital visits), economics (e.g., number of purchases), or environmental science (e.g., number of rare species observed).\n",
        "\n",
        "***Example***\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider data on the number of times people visit a doctor in a year. Many people may not visit a doctor at all (zeros), while others visit a variable number of times. In this case: - The **first part** of the hurdle model would predict the likelihood that someone visits the doctor at least once. - The **second part** would model the number of visits, conditional on having at least one visit.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Difference from Zero-Inflated Models***\n",
        "\n",
        "Although both hurdle models and zero-inflated models address excess zeros, they are conceptually different: - **Hurdle models** assume a zero outcome is a result of a distinct process (e.g., some people never visit the doctor). - **Zero-inflated models** assume there are two types of zeros: \"structural zeros\" (those who never visit the doctor) and \"sampling zeros\" (those who could visit but didn't in a given period).\n",
        "\n",
        "As we discuss before, the hurdle model consists of two components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1\\. **Binary Component**: A **logistic (or binomial) regression** that models whether the count is zero or non-zero (i.e., whether the hurdle is crossed).\n",
        "\n",
        "This part of the model predicts whether the outcome is zero or positive.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ P(Y_i = 0 | X) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(X\\beta)} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "\n",
        "$Y_i = 0$ indicates that the count is zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "\\- $X$ represents the predictor variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "\\- $\\beta$ represents the coefficients estimated by logistic regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "This component uses logistic regression to estimate the probability of zeros (whether or not the \"hurdle\" is crossed).\n",
        "\n",
        "2\\. **Truncated Count Component** (Positive count): Once the hurdle has been crossed (i.e., we have a positive count), the second part of the model predicts the non-zero counts. This part models only the positive counts and ignores the zeros.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a **truncated Poisson regression**, the probability mass function is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ P(Y_i = k | Y_i > 0, X) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!(1 - e^{-\\lambda})} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where: -\n",
        "\n",
        "$k > 0$ represents the non-zero counts.\n",
        "\n",
        "\\- $\\lambda = \\exp(X\\gamma)$ is the mean of the Poisson distribution, with $X$ as the predictors and $\\gamma$) as the coefficients.\n",
        "\n",
        "\\- $e^{-\\lambda}$ is the probability of zero in the untruncated Poisson model.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a **truncated Negative Binomial regression**, the equation would incorporate the dispersion parameter $\\theta$ to handle overdispersion:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ P(Y_i = k | Y_i > 0, X) = \\frac{\\Gamma(k + \\theta^{-1})}{k! \\Gamma(\\theta^{-1})} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda + \\theta^{-1}} \\right)^k \\left( \\frac{\\theta^{-1}}{\\lambda + \\theta^{-1}} \\right)^{\\theta^{-1}} $$\n",
        "\n",

We applied the hurdle model using both Poisson and negative binomial distributions to model two key processes: whether an individual visits the doctor at all and, if they do, how often they visit.\n",
        "\n",
        "By fitting and interpreting the hurdle model in R, we've demonstrated how to address complex zero-inflated count data scenarios, providing a clearer understanding of the relationships between predictors and outcomes. This method can be extended to other real-world problems where excess zeros and over-dispersion are prevalent."
